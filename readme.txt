## ANGULAR GUIDE


# ANGULAR COMPONENT

Made up of three parts 
i. TEMPLATE - which represents the view (created using HTML)

ii. CLASS - nothing but code that supports the view (created using typescript)
			contains data properties and methods and can be used to control the logic of the view.

iii. METADATA - information angular needs to decide if the particular class is in fact an angular
				component or just a regular class.
